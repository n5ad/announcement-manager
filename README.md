This feature was inspired by KD5FMU, Freddie Mac, the Ham Radio Crusader. His Audio_Convert and Playaudio script files are the basis for this feature.You do not need to install his versions before installing this as this will handle the install for its own needs. 

Here is the basic instuctions

first lets get to s specific directory after you after started an SSH session into your node
```
cd /etc/asterisk/local
```
Then lets download the installer script

```

```
Then lets make that script file executable
```
sudo chmod +x announcement_manager.sh

```
